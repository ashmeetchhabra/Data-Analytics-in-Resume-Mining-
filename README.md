<center><h2>What is "Data Analytics in Resume Mining!!"</h2></center>
<p margin="20px">Data Analytics in Resume Mining!! is the combination of two words-<b>"Data Analytics"</b> and <b>"Resume Mining"</b>.<br><br>Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth, so <b>Resume Mining</b> is extraction or generation of the resume by taking the information from the students.<br>
There is a additional functionality of <b>Data Analysis</b> in this project that, the students can get categorized according to the company criteria by the analysis of there current CGPA. </p>
<p>It is written in Python,uses wxPython for building GUI,SQLite Database,Bottle Micro Web Framework.It can be executed on every platform.</p>

<h3>
    1.Python
</h3>
<p>Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.

</p>
<p>
Python is a multi-paradigm programming language: <b>object-oriented programming</b> and <b>structured programming</b> are fully supported, and there are a number of language features which support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming and by magic methods).</p>
<h3>
    2.wxPython
</h3>
<p>wxPython is a wrapper for the cross-platform GUI API (often referred to as a 'toolkit') wxWidgets (which is written in C++) for the Python programming language. It is one of the alternatives to Tkinter, which is bundled with Python. It is implemented as a Python extension module (native code). Other popular alternatives are PyGTK, its successor PyGObject and PyQt. Like wxWidgets, wxPython is free software.
</p>
<h3>
    3.SQLite
</h3>
<p>
SQLite is a relational database management system contained in a C programming library. In contrast to many other database management systems, SQLite is not a client-server database engine.Rather, it is embedded into the end program.
</p>
<p>
SQLite is ACID-compliant and implements most of the SQL standard, using a dynamically and weakly typed SQL syntax that does not guarantee the domain integrity.
</p>
<h3>
    4.Bottle Micro Framework
</h3>

<p>
Bottle is a fast, simple and lightweight WSGI micro web-framework for Python. It is distributed as a single file module and has no dependencies other than the Python Standard Library.
<ul>
   <li> Routing: Requests to function-call mapping with support for clean and dynamic URLs.</li>
   <li> Templates: Fast and pythonic built-in template engine and support for mako, jinja2 and cheetah templates.</li>
  <li>  Utilities: Convenient access to form data, file uploads, cookies, headers and other HTTP-related metadata.</li>
    <li>Server: Built-in HTTP development server and support for paste, fapws3, bjoern, gae, cherrypy or any other WSGI capable HTTP server.</li>
</ul></p>
